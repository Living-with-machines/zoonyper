# How to contribute?

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. üéâ

We're excited to have you join our community of contributors who are helping to advance science and discovery through citizen science. Here's how you can get involved and make a difference:

## Understanding the Repository

Before you start contributing, it's important to understand what this repository is all about. Our goal is to process the data results generated by the Zooniverse platform, which is the world's largest and most successful citizen science platform. Zooniverse provides a way for people from all over the world to participate in scientific research by doing tasks that are too time-consuming for researchers to do themselves.

‚≠êÔ∏è You are acknowledged for all kinds of contributions

In this repository, we use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) that help us recognise all contributors, even when they don't directly contribute on the repository.
You can find all [emoji/Type keywords](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) representing the types of contribution. 

To add a contributor, comment on Issue or Pull Request (where the contributor is involved) using this message for @all-contributors:
`@all-contributors please add @<username> for <keyword in the Type column>`

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have a basic understanding of the Zooniverse platform and the data processing involved. You can find more information about the platform and how it works on the [Zooniverse website]([url](https://www.zooniverse.org/)).

## Contributing to the Repository

Once you have a good understanding of the Zooniverse platform and the data processing involved, you can start contributing to the repository. There are several ways to get involved:

**Fixing bugs**: If you find a bug in the repository, you can help by fixing it. This is a great way to get started and make your first contribution. For open issues in this repository, please see the [Issues section](../../issues).

**Improving documentation**: Documentation is important for any open-source project, and this repository is no exception. If you find that something is unclear or could be improved, feel free to make changes and contribute.

**Adding new features**: If you have an idea for a new feature that would improve the repository, we'd love to hear about it. Please open an issue to discuss your idea and get feedback from other contributors.

## Submitting Contributions

Once you've made changes to the repository, you can submit your contribution by opening a pull request. A pull request is a way to propose changes to the repository and get feedback from other contributors.

When you open a pull request, please make sure to describe the changes you made and motivate them ‚Äî tell us why they're important.

## Code of Conduct

We ask all contributors to follow our code of conduct, which is [available in the repository](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The code of conduct outlines our expectations for behavior and helps ensure that everyone is treated with respect and dignity.

## Join the Community

We're a friendly and welcoming community, and we'd love for you to join us! You can find us on our chat channel or mailing list, where you can ask questions, get help, and connect with other contributors.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository! We look forward to working with you.
